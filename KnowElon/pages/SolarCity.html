				<a id="Tesla"><h2>Solar leasing</h2></a>
				<p>In 2008, SolarCity entered the solar leasing market with a new solar lease option for homeowners: 
					leasing rooftop solar to customers who would pay no upfront costs. In exchange, customers paid for 
					20 years for power generated by those panels. <br>SolarCity's solar lease allowed some homeowners to 
					pay less each month than they previously paid for electricity from the utility company.</p>
				<br>
				<p>The "no-money-down solar" business model became the most popular in the U.S. and increased installations, 
					but it also added considerably to SolarCity's debt, accounting for about half of the company's over $3 
					billion debt in 2016.</p>

				<p>Solar energy systems have generally been installed by mounting solar panels on an existing roof.<br>
					In August 2016, Musk announced that Tesla would be introducing a new product called the Tesla Solar 
					Roof. </p>
				<br>
				<p>In the product, the photovoltaic energy-generating devices and system make up an entire roof surface. 
					He stated "It’s not a thing on a roof. It is the roof."</p>
