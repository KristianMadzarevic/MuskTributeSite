				<a id="SpaceX"><h2>How it started...</h2></a>
				<p>Elon Musk announced the existence of The Boring Company in December 2016. By February 2017, the 
				company had begun digging a 30-foot-wide (9 m), 50-foot-long (15 m), and 15-foot-deep (4.6 m) 
				testing trench on the premises of SpaceX's offices in Hawthorne, since construction on its site would not 
				require any permits.</p>

				<p>The first three boring machines used by The Boring Company are:<br>-Godot, a conventional tunnel boring 
					machine made by Canadian company Lovat which is used for research purposes.<br>-Line-storm, a highly 
					modified conventional boring machine.<br>-Prufrock is a "fully-Boring-Company-designed machine"</p>

				<a id="The Boring Company"><h2>Future plans</h2></a>
				<p>According to Musk, the company's goal is to enhance tunnelling speed enough such that establishing a 
					tunnel network is financially feasible. <br>"If you think of tunnels going 10, 20, 30 layers deep 
					(or more), it is obvious that going 3D down will encompass the needs of any city’s transport of arbitrary 
					size."<br>-Elon Musk</p>
				<br>
				<p>Future boring operations will implement a contemporaneous operation of boring and tunnel reinforcement 
					to reduce the cost of the tunnelling operations, in addition to the reduction of tunnel size, re-using soil 
					materials for tunnel construction, and further technological improvements.</p>
