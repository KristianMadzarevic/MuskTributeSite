				<a id="SpaceX"><h2>Origins</h2></a>
				<p>Founded in July 2003 by engineers Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning as Tesla Motors, the company’s 
					name is a tribute to inventor and electrical engineer Nikola Tesla.<br>The next three employees were Ian Wright, 
					Elon Musk, and J. B. Straubel, all of whom are named as co-founders of the company.</p>
				<br>
				<p>Musk, who formerly served as chairman and is the current CEO, said that he envisioned Tesla Motors as a 
					technology company and independent automaker, aimed at eventually offering electric cars at prices 
					affordable to the average consumer. In February 2017, Tesla Motors shortened its name to Tesla, Inc.</p>
