				<a id="SpaceX"><h2>Achievements</h2></a>
				<p>SpaceX's achievements include:<br>-the first privately funded liquid-propellant rocket to reach orbit 
					(Falcon 1 in 2008),<br>-the first private company to successfully launch, orbit, and recover a spacecraft 
					(Dragon in 2010),<br>-the first private company to send a spacecraft to the International Space Station (Dragon in 2012),
					<br>-the first propulsive landing for an orbital rocket (Falcon 9 in 2015),<br>-the first reuse of an orbital rocket 
					(Falcon 9 in 2017),<br>-the first private company to launch an object into orbit around the Sun (Falcon Heavy's payload 
					of a Tesla Roadster in 2018),<br>-the first private company to send astronauts to orbit and to the International 
					Space Station (SpaceX Crew Dragon Demo-2 Mission in 2020).</p>
					<br>
				<p>SpaceX has flown 20 cargo resupply missions 
					to the International Space Station (ISS) under a partnership with NASA, as well as an uncrewed demonstration 
					flight of the human-rated Dragon 2 spacecraft (Crew Demo-1) on March 2, 2019, and the first crewed Dragon 2 
					flight on May 30, 2020.</p>

				<a id="Tesla"><h2>Accidents</h2></a>
				<p>In March 2013, a Dragon spacecraft in orbit developed issues with its thrusters that limited its control
					capabilities. SpaceX engineers were able to remotely clear the blockages within a short period, and the 
					spacecraft was able to successfully complete its mission to and from the International Space Station.</p>
					<br>
				<p>On June 28, 2019, SpaceX announced that it had lost contact with three of the 60 satellites making up the Starlink 
					mega constellation. The dysfunctional satellites' orbits are expected to slowly decay until they disintegrate in 
					the atmosphere. However, the rate of failure for satellites in mega-constellations consisting of thousands of 
					satellites has raised concerns that these constellations could litter the Earth's lower orbit, with serious 
					detrimental consequences for future space flights.</p>

				<a id="The Boring Company"><h2>Research</h2></a>
				<p>SpaceX is actively pursuing several different research and development programs. 
					Most notable are those intended to develop a <strong>Reusable launch system</strong> 
					and the <strong>Starship</strong></p>
				<p>SpaceX's <strong>reusable launcher program</strong> was publicly announced in 2011 and the design phase was completed in 
					February 2012. The system returns the first stage of a Falcon 9 rocket to a predetermined landing site 
					using only its own propulsion systems.</p>
				<p><strong>Starship</strong> is a fully reusable second stage and space vehicle intended to replace all of the company's 
					existing launch vehicle hardware by the early 2020s; plus ground infrastructure for rapid launch and 
					relaunch and zero-gravity propellant transfer technology in low Earth orbit (LEO).</p>
